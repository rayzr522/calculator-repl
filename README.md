# Calculator REPL

> A simple REPL calculator program written in C++ for learning purposes

This is my attempt at making a REPL calculator in C++. This is one of my first projects in **C++**, so I'll be surprised if I even manage to compile this thing.

## Usage

    calculator-repl

All useable commands can be seen by typing `help` or `?` in the REPL prompt.

## Compiling

Compiling on macOS or Linux is as simple as cloning this repository and running `scripts/build.sh`, assuming you have `g++` installed. If you use Windows, well... good luck, I can't be bothered to figure out some way to compile for you people. Linux is better anyways :P
